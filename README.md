I had the idea for this project after watching this youtube video by Engineer Man: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_chP0a4PMTM&ab_channel=EngineerMan).

I thought it was a fun project and there was a few ways that I could expand and improve upon it.

## Enhancements

- Command line args
- More efficient print to terminal using ANSI escape codes
- Wind
- Snow accumulation
- Colors (white, red and green, and random colors)
- And MORE!

## Goals for the Project

I made this code to get further experience working with GitHub and python. I also got to learn about optimization techniques, code readability techniques and ansii escape codes!

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the latest version of python installed. To download, please see: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Download this repository. If you need help, please see [Cloning a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
3. Run `python3 snowstorm.py` or a similar command to run the code and see your first snowstorm!
4. Check usage with `python3 snowstorm.py --help` for more specific usage and customization of your snowstorm.

## Have fun with your new in-terminal snowstorm!
