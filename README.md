# Snowstorm

I had the idea after watching this youtube video by Engineer Man: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_chP0a4PMTM&ab_channel=EngineerMan).

I thought it was a fun project and there was a few ways that I could expand and improve upon it.

## Enhancements

- Command line args
- More efficient print to terminal using ANSI escape codes
- Wind
- Snow accumulation
- Colors (white, red and green, and random colors)
